### Non-Fickian PINN
This file is to list the working parameters to run the chebfun testcases.
The parameters used for the chebfun cases can be seen in the `chebfun` folder, multirate1.m file, or in each folder in the p.csv file which is structured as follows:
```
porosity
diffusion_coefficient
advection_coefficient
mobile_immobile_ratio
exchange_rate
```

### testcase0
# pure diffusion
Here all works, PINN and inverse PINN
see file results/testcase0.py

### testcase4
# advection diffusion Pe=1
work in progress

### testcase5
# advection diffusion Pe=100
Kind of works, PINN and inverse PINN
see file results/testcase5.py


### testcase6
# pure diffusion with time-dependent BC
work in progress


### testcase1
# advection diffusion with mobile-immobile
# 100x100 data points
inverse PINN does not work, PINN seemed to work with the following parameters
```python
pde_weight = 1.0
data_weight = 1.0
ic_weight = 100.0
bc_weight = 10.0
learning_rate = 3e-4
epochs = 400
train_parameters = False
num_hidden_layers = 20
num_neurons_per_layer = 40
```

### testcase2
# advection diffusion with mobile-immobile
# fewer data points (10,10)
TBD
